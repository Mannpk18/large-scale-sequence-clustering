# Large-Scale Sequence Clustering & Compression

## Problem
Biological sequence datasets are extremely large and contain redundancy, making storage and processing inefficient.

## Approach
Built a pipeline to:
- extract k-mer features
- cluster similar sequences
- compress grouped sequences
- compare compression ratios

## Focus
This project required thinking about data representation, indexing, and memory efficiency.

## Key Insight
Data organization often matters more than compression algorithm choice.
